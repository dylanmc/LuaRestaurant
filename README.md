LuaRestaurant
=============

By Audra and Dylan McNamee

This is a Lua LÃ¶ve program.  You'll need to have Love installed (https://love2d.org).  We run it from the console by typing 

    love `pwd`  

from the command line.

Right now, you're just launched into the game -- you're managing a restaurant.  A line of blue customers arrives - you click on the line to select the first customer, and then choose a table to seat them. After they've thought a while, they order, you click on them to take their order.

The kitchen produces the food they chose - you click on it to pick it up, and deliver it to the table.  After they've eaten, they leave money that you click on to collect, and then you can seat another customer.
